# Concise.js

(WIP)

_Concise.js_ is an experimental frontend framework. The general philosophy is to remove as much junk as possible, leaving you with only straight javascript and HTML elements that are immediately alive and ready to be manipulated the moment they are defined. Concise.js is built upon Connected.js, a never-polling 2-way data binding library.
